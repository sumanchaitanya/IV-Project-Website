ABSTRACT:
The transition to electric mobility is a promising global strategy for de carbonizing the 
transport sector. India is among a handful of countries that support the global EV30@30 
campaign, which targets to have at least 30% new vehicle sales be electric by 2030. The 
Government of India has instituted various enabling policies to promote the development of the 
charging infrastructure network. The primary audience for this handbook includes public and 
private sector stakeholders that are responsible for charging infrastructure implementation, such 
as electricity distribution companies, municipal corporations, urban development authorities, 
and charge point solutions providers and operators. This project offers the improvement and 
validation of the charging station to be access easily using currency based architecture. The 
existing method EV station give an option to use the station through only the application. And 
the major problem of existing system is in the process of charging time we cannot disconnect 
the charger for the emergency purpose. If we disconnect the charger, we lost the particular 
amount of money. So in this project we proposed currency based return policy EV station to 
rectify the problems. 
KEYWORDS: Deep learning, RFID, Keypad, EV charging.
